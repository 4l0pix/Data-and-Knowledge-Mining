Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Know and understand proven issues in the field of data mining.

- Know and have a critical view of modern developments at the cutting edge of the field of data mining.

- Know data mining methodologies and techniques, as well as their use for solving typical problems.

- Combine their knowledge to develop methodologies that ensure the successful solution of new, complex, problems at the level of study and real problems.

- They have developed the knowledge acquisition skills in this field that they need to continue in further studies with a high degree of autonomy.

- They communicate information, ideas, problems and solutions to both specialist and non-specialist audiences.

- They collaborate with their colleagues to create and present case studies.

- They use the knowledge they have acquired in a way that shows a professional approach to their work.
